#Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year


# Define the principal, rate, and time
P = 200  # Principal amount in Rs.
R = 5    # Rate of interest per year in %
T = 4    # Time period in years

# Calculate simple interest
SI = (P * R * T) / 100

# Display the result
print(f"The Simple Interest on Rs.{P} for {T} years at {R}% per year is Rs.{SI}.")
